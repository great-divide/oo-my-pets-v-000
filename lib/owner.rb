* When an owner plays with a cat or feeds a fish or walks a dog, that pet will get happier. Remember that the `pets` method stores all of an owners pets. The `@pets` hash stored in that method is full of *instances of the `Cat`/`Dog`/`Fish` class*. That means you can call `Cat`/`Dog`/`Fish` instance methods (such as `.mood=`) on those pets.
